# Discord Light Contoller
 Control your Smart Lights via a Discord Bot.

## What's next?
I've got a lot of future plans of features and updates for this project.. let's hope I actually get to them and not abandon them like every single other side-project! If I do, then you can gladly add the feature on a fork of this repository and create a pull-request. Boom! Now you have something new to add to your portfolio or resume :o
- Web-Based Dashboard in either Express/EJS or Vue w/ Express backend
- Light Modes (Police, Smooth RGB, Flashing, ect)
- Per light commands?


## Credits
Huge shout out the the following people/organizations for making Discord Light Controller possible with my limited knowledge on the new v13/v14 Discord JS Library!
